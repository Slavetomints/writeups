Welcome to Bandit! This is OverTheWire's beginner wargame and is meant to be an introduction to how the other wargames work. This makes it a wonderful place to get acquainted with UNIX systems.

bandit0 is extremely easy by design, its whole purpose is to get you familiar with the syntax for `ssh` since it is what you will be using to connect to the challenge server for each level.

The syntax for `ssh` is `ssh user@host -p port`. When it asks to continue connecting because it doesn't know the fingerprint it means that it's never connected to this host before, and want you to confirm that this is the right host. It then asks us for the password, which we are provided in the challenge description.

```

                      This is an OverTheWire game server. 
            More information on http://www.overthewire.org/wargames

bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org's password: 
```

Great! Welcome to the server! Let's take a look around and see what we can find here.

```

bandit0@bandit:~$ ls
readme
```

Now before we check out that file, if you've never wondered what the `bandit0@bandit:~$` means on the command line, let's quickly look at that.

The first part is the username for the active user, who in this case is `bandit0`. If you want to find out for yourself who the active user is, run the command `whoami` in the command line.

The next part, the `bandit` is the hostname of the machine. You can also find this out by running the aptly named command `hostname`.

```

bandit0@bandit:~$ whoami
bandit0
bandit0@bandit:~$ hostname
bandit
```

The "~", called a tilde, is your current location on the file system. The tilde means the users home directory. If you go to another user's home directory, you'll see the full path to it, but you only see the tilde if it is your own home directory.

```

bandit0@bandit:~$ cd /home/bandit1
bandit0@bandit:/home/bandit1$ cd /home/bandit0
bandit0@bandit:~$ 
```

Now, what does the `$` mean? It means that you are a user with normal user privileges. if you were the root user you'd likely see a `#` instead, indicating that you have elevated admin privileges.

Okay! So now lets look at the file we found earlier!

```

bandit0@bandit:~$ cat readme
