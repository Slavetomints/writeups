      # Binary Search

      Challenge description:
      
      > Want to play a game? As you use more of the shell, you might be interested in how they work! Binary search is a classic algorithm used to quickly find an item in a sorted list. Can you find the flag? You'll have 1000 possibilities and only 10 guesses. Cyber security often has a huge amount of data to look through - from logs, vulnerability reports, and forensics. Practicing the fundamentals manually might help you in the future when you have to write your own tools! You can download the challenge files here:
      >
      > [challenge.zip](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c_atlas/19/challenge.zip)
      >
      > `ssh -p 63188 ctf-player@atlas.picoctf.net` Using the password `1db87a14`. Accept the fingerprint with `yes`, and `ls` once connected to begin. Remember, in a shell, passwords are hidden!
      
      Alright, lets download the zip and take a look at whats inside!
      
      ## guessing_game.sh
      
      ```bash
      
      #!/bin/bash
      
      # Generate a random number between 1 and 1000
      target=$(( (RANDOM % 1000) + 1 ))
      
      echo "Welcome to the Binary Search Game!"
      echo "I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 1000."
      
      # Trap signals to prevent exiting
      trap 'echo "Exiting is not allowed."' INT
      trap '' SIGQUIT
      trap '' SIGTSTP
      
      # Limit the player to 10 guesses
      MAX_GUESSES=10
      guess_count=0
      
      while (( guess_count < MAX_GUESSES )); do
          read -p "Enter your guess: " guess
      
          if ! [[ "$guess" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then
              echo "Please enter a valid number."
              continue
          fi
      
          (( guess_count++ ))
      
          if (( guess < target )); then
              echo "Higher! Try again."
          elif (( guess > target )); then
              echo "Lower! Try again."
          else
              echo "Congratulations! You guessed the correct number: $target"
      
              # Retrieve the flag from the metadata file
              flag=$(cat /challenge/metadata.json | jq -r '.flag')
              echo "Here's your flag: $flag"
              exit 0  # Exit with success code
          fi
      done
      
      # Player has exceeded maximum guesses
      echo "Sorry, you've exceeded the maximum number of guesses."
      exit 1  # Exit with error code to close the connection
      ```
      
      Hm, this is troubling. We only have 10 guesses to guess a single number out of 1000 possibilities. While it might seem impossible without extreme luck, there's actually a guaranteed way to do it.
      
      A binary search algorithm will split the "array" of values in half, and check if that middle number is greater than, less than, or equal to the value that it is looking for, and eliminate the half that it is greater than or equal to, and repeat the process. 
      
      This GIF from Wikipedia should help demonstrate:

      So lets apply it here, and reap the rewards!

      Welcome to the Binary Search Game!
      I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 1000.
      Enter your guess: 500
      Higher! Try again.
      Enter your guess: 750
      Lower! Try again.
      Enter your guess: 625
      Higher! Try again.
      Enter your guess: 690
      Lower! Try again.
      Enter your guess: 656
      Lower! Try again.
      Enter your guess: 641
      Lower! Try again.
      Enter your guess: 634
      Higher! Try again.
      Enter your guess: 638
      Congratulations! You guessed the correct number: 638
      Here's your flag: picoCTF{g00d_gu355_1597707f}
      Connection to atlas.picoctf.net closed.
